# 26/07/25 start 4:30 end 1am 27/07/25 ( 8h 30 mins )

its rly late so ill upadte this batter later but i spend a bunch of time researching and planning the robot aswell as making a wiring diagram

so the robot plan is a tank drive with a flipper (ik tank drives quite well cos of frc and i trust i can design stuff)

i think my plan for tmmrw is instead of doing the hyper critical tution work i have i instead redesign the arduino nano (schematic atleast so i can tweak the pcb when i need too)
on that note here are my plans


i want to sleep so ill update this later but more or less i got the 

1. stronk tank drive with crowned pullies for wheels and a 4 bar linkages flipper with massive inspiration from maker muse
2. no esc make ur own stuff
3. remake the nano so that it perfectly fits the drive base and that way i save a bit of space and weight
4. use pcb to also make parts like maybe the 4bar arm cos 3d printing isnt that stronk
5. tpu armour 
4. stuff

   # 27/07/25 5h thoughout day
i want to sleep so this is gonna be short but ive made a few concept sketches of the flipper arm and the cad design in general, also the the train ride i remade the arduino nano schematic based on a few screenshots (then found out arduino is open source and they had files with the schematic already) regardless when the cad is done im gonna make the arduino nano to fit even though im prob not going to use it due to weight and reliability/cost issues
 proper update soon
