i think my plan for tmmrw is instead of doing the hyper critical tution work i have i instead redesign the arduino nano (schematic atleast so i can tweak the pcb when i need too)
on that note here are my plans

1. stronk tank drive with crowned pullies for wheels and a 4 bar linkages flipper with massive inspiration from maker muse
2. no esc make ur own stuff
3. remake the nano so that it perfectly fits the drive base and that way i save a bit of space and weight
4. use pcb to also make parts like maybe the 4bar arm cos 3d printing isnt that stronk
5. tpu armour 
4. stuff
